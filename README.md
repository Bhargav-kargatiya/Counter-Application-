## Countdown Timer

This project is a simple countdown timer implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can set a target date and time, and the application will display the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the target is reached. Upon completion, the timer displays a message indicating that the countdown has finished. The timer includes features to start, pause, resume, and cancel the countdown.
